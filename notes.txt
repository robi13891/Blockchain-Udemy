- Definition: Immutable Distributed Ledger
- Proof of Work: 
    we wanna make sure that each mined block is legitimate 
    (correct data and correct transactions) and we do it with proof of work mechanism.
    When is to calculate the hash of a block we require that the hash starts
    with a fixed number of zeros.
    This method secures our blockchain because if someone wants to corrupt a previous
    block a lot of computer power is needed because he has to calculate again that block 
    hash and all the followers.
    Moreover the network will reject his proposal because is different form all of
    the others.
    WHAT IF AN ADDRESS POSSESS THE MAJORITY OF NODES?
